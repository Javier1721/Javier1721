        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response:I hoped to get basic knowledge of html, css, and jquery. I wanted to be able to make my own portfolio website. I hope to continue to try and figure this coding thing out because right now its still very much a blur but I hope to get a better understanding soon. A cool site I can think of is like the Nike ID website where you’re in the customization phase. I think it is so cool the way in real time you can see how your product will look.  </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter? </p>
        <p>Response:I am planning on making a frank ocean website that will showcase all of his albums. I first wanted to add some images of frank ocean himself that I will manipulate to be cohesive across the website but also will be relative to each album page. I will use one color all across my website with strong bold typography. </p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt:When we design, we are telling a story. We tell it through visuals, through content, and through the paths we lead our viewers on. When we can imagine a viewer to tell our story to, it can make for a stronger design. It helps us focus on crafting our story.
 
          This week’s journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you; it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.
          </p>
        <p>Response:Well this person is someone who is very much into pop culture and follows every “hype” streetwear and sneaker trends. This person can’t live without music and loves to sing when they get the chance. Frank Ocean means a lot to them because the songs and feelings they give helped them through tough times.

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt:Why did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? What bothers you about them? How will you improve things in your own design?</p>
        <p>Response:I chose to redesign a friend of mine's website. He is a barber in my area. I feel my website will much better channel the feel of who he is as a person. I feel I will be able to capture that in my design.  I feel after looking around I want to make sure that my website is unique. I feel as if no baber has a real custom website they all look generic. </p>

        <h2>Week Nine</h2>
        <p>Prompt:This one's about "why." Read this article (try to pretend it's not a cheezy article about business success). Spend some time thinking about why you are pursuing a career in design. Really dig down, do the 7 "whys" tool in the article. OR If that's too challenging right now, consider people in your life or people who've inspired you. Think about what drives them, what their "why" is. Why did they work so hard to do XYZ, was it from past experiences they had, was it because they saw a need they were called to fill? What's their deeper "why?" Ask them if you know them, or look up some biographical information and try to figure it out. Write about either you or your inspiration.</p>
        <p>Response: 
          I want to pursue design to create and make things that people will enjoy. 
          That will help me feel the joy of feeling important for contributing to society 
          Contributing to society gives you meaning but on top of that I feel it will give me a job that I will enjoy because it's an ever evolving field. The job will help me provide for my family. Taking care of my family will also give me the sense of meaning. I feel like all in all design will lead me into a field that hopefully won’t get boring to satisfy that sense of meaning at work for myself but also help me provide for my family that will also give me a sense of satisfaction all while contributing to the ever growing world of design leaving my mark hopefully.
